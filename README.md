# Ldstr Obfuscation and Deobfuscation

This repository provides code samples and utilities for obfuscating and deobfuscating strings within .NET applications (Ldstr instructions). Designed for those interested in reverse engineering or improving .NET application security, this repository pairs with tutorials on using dnSpy to analyze and manipulate strings in .NET assemblies.

## Features

- **Obfuscation**: Secure strings in .NET applications by replacing plain-text strings with encrypted values.
- **Deobfuscation**: Decrypt obfuscated strings for readability or debugging purposes.
- **Integration**: Compatible with dnSpy for real-time analysis and manipulation of Ldstr instructions. (lol)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheHellTower/XorStr.git
   ```
2. **Explore Examples**: The examples directory contains sample codes and instructions to start obfuscating and deobfuscating strings.
3. **Usage with dnSpy**: Refer to the [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/HBn5tIOhfF8) for detailed steps on using dnSpy with the provided codes.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET Framework or .NET Core SDK** (Version 3.5 and up)
- **dnSpy** (optional but recommended for analysis and live debugging)

## Usage

## YouTube Tutorial
